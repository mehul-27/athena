You are a research strategist. Before searching, analyze this question and create a research plan.

**Question:** {question}

Break this question down:
1. What are the key sub-topics that need to be covered for a comprehensive answer?
2. What specific data points, facts, or perspectives should we look for?
3. What would a complete, high-quality answer include?

Return a JSON object with:
- "sub_questions": Array of 3-6 specific sub-questions to investigate
- "key_topics": Array of key topics/angles to cover
- "success_criteria": One sentence describing what a complete answer looks like

Example:
{{
  "sub_questions": ["What is the cost of living in X?", "How is the healthcare system?"],
  "key_topics": ["economy", "healthcare", "safety", "culture"],
  "success_criteria": "A balanced comparison covering cost, quality of life, and practical considerations."

You are deciding whether a research report is comprehensive enough.

**Original question:** {question}

**Rounds completed:** {round_num} of {max_rounds}

Based on the report so far, do we have enough information to answer the question comprehensively? Consider:
- Are the key aspects of the question addressed?
- Are there obvious gaps or unanswered sub-questions?
- Is the evidence sufficient and from multiple sources?

If rounds completed is well below the target, prefer continuing unless the report is already exhaustive.

Reply with ONLY "YES" or "NO" followed by a brief one-sentence reason.
Example: "YES — The report covers all major aspects with evidence from multiple sources."
